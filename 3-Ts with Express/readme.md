# TypeScript Project Integration

## Overview

This guide illustrates how to integrate TypeScript with a project that utilizes Express for building web applications. The project includes routes for handling user authentication and protected routes, demonstrating the integration of TypeScript's type system with Express.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- TypeScript (`typescript` package)

## Steps

1.  Initialize a TypeScript Project: Begin by initializing a new TypeScript project using npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

    bashCopy code

    `npm init -y`

2.  Install Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies, including TypeScript:

    bashCopy code

    `npm install typescript`

3.  Set up TypeScript Configuration: Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory of your project. This file specifies the TypeScript compiler options. You can generate a basic `tsconfig.json` file using the following command:

    bashCopy code

    `npx tsc --init`

4.  Write Express Routes: Define routes for your Express application in TypeScript files (`*.ts`). Include routes for user authentication, protected routes, and any other endpoints required for your application.

5.  Compile TypeScript to JavaScript: Compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). You can do this manually by running `tsc` in the terminal or set up a build script in your `package.json` file.

6.  Run the Application: Start your application by running the compiled JavaScript file (`*.js`) using Node.js. You can do this by running `node <compiled-file>` in the terminal.
