# TypeScript Code Repository

Welcome to the TypeScript Code Repository! This repository contains code examples and projects demonstrating various aspects of TypeScript development, organized into three main folders:

## 1\. ts-basics

This folder contains fundamental TypeScript code examples. Here you will find introductory examples covering basic syntax, types, functions, classes, interfaces, and more. These examples serve as a starting point for understanding TypeScript fundamentals.

## 2\. code-reuse-and-design-patterns

In this folder, you'll find examples focused on code reuse techniques and design patterns in TypeScript. Explore concepts such as modules, mixins, generics, and commonly used design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Strategy, and Observer. These examples aim to showcase best practices for structuring and designing TypeScript applications for maintainability and scalability.

## 3\. express-with-ts

The `express-with-ts` folder contains project and examples related to building web applications using Express.js with TypeScript. Dive into examples demonstrating how to set up Express.js with TypeScript, create routes, handle requests and responses, integrate middleware, and leverage TypeScript's static typing features for robust and maintainable web applications.
