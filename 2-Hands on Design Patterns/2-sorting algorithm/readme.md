# Sorting Algorithms and Data Structures

## Project Overview

Sorting algorithms are essential tools in computer science used to organize data efficiently. This project aims to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm, a simple yet fundamental sorting technique, along with the necessary data structures to support sorting operations.

## Project Objectives

1.  Implementation of Bubble Sort: The primary objective of this project is to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm in TypeScript. Bubble Sort is a comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Despite its simplicity and inefficiency for large datasets, Bubble Sort serves as a good educational tool for understanding sorting algorithms.

2.  Support for Various Data Types: The project supports sorting of strings and arrays of numbers. Separate classes are provided for sorting strings and arrays of numbers, each implementing the Bubble Sort algorithm. Additionally, a basic implementation for sorting linked lists is included.

3.  Abstract Data Structures: The project introduces abstract data structures such as interfaces and abstract classes. The `Sortable` interface defines the properties and methods required for sorting, while the `Sorter` abstract class implements common sorting functionality and algorithm. This abstraction allows for the implementation of sorting algorithms for different data types.

4.  Educational Resource: Beyond providing functional code, this project serves as an educational resource for learning about sorting algorithms and data structures. Detailed comments and explanations are included in the code to facilitate understanding, making it suitable for beginners and students learning about algorithms and TypeScript programming.

## Usage

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install TypeScript if not already installed (`npm install -g typescript`).
- Compile the TypeScript files (`tsc`).
- Use the compiled JavaScript files in your project with (`npm start`).
